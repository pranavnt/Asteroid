### Auth

#### Login

#### SignUp

### Create

#### Create a collection

In order to create a collection, run the command `asteroid create collection collectionName` into terminal, as a collection with `collectionName` will be created. This can only be done from the command line for now, but I'm hoping to allow devs to be able to do this through an API in the future.

#### Create a document

Send a POST request to `/api/collection/{collectionName}/create/document` where `collectionName` is the name of the collection the document should be created in.
You should post the json you want to be stored in that document, with the key of `uid` being the user id. Here is sample JSON that could be posted:

```json
{
  "uid": "userid",
  "data1": "hello",
  "key2": "world"
}
```

### Read

#### Get Document by ID

To get a document by its id, send a GET request to `/api/collection/{collectionName}/document/read/{_id}`, where `_id` is the document id.

#### Get Documents by User ID

`/api/collection/{collectionName}/document/read/user/{uid}`

#### Get All Documents from collection

`/api/collection/{collectionName}/all`

### Update

#### Update element in collection

#### Update collection name

### Delete

#### Delete document from collection

To delete a document from a collection, send a GET request to `/api/collection/todos/document/delete/{uid}/{_id}`. Here, `uid` will be the userid and `_id` will be the document id.

#### Delete Collection

To delete a collection, run the command `asteroid delete collection collectionName` into terminal, and the collection with the name `collectionName` will be deleted. You can only do this through the CLI right now, but I'm hoping to make this accessible via an API in the future.
